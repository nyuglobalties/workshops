# Data Team Workshops

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Welcome to the Data Team workshops page! If you want to learn R or use the tools in our data pipeline, you've come to the right place. Over time we'll add more and more tutorials to cover a breadth of topics so that you can explore the R ecosystem and see how it could benefit your workflow.

## Tutorial References

Much of our R tutorials are based on the exceptionally handy [_R for Data Science_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Grolemund and Wickham. Rather than following a standard "computer science"-like approach of teaching the language fundamentals without application, Grolemund and Wickham take an application-first approach by going through the basics of data import, munging, and analysis while teaching the language on the side. For extra reading and exercises, we highly encourage perusing this text.

Once you feel comfortable working with R, the [RStudio cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are an invaluable resource when you need some form of quick reference. The sheets are designed so that you can _visually_ understand what the functions are doing, which builds a stronger intuition than just reading the function documentation.

## Setup

All tutorials are located in this package, so you will need to download this repository. We'll have a git & Github tutorial soon, but for now we'll cover the basics just to get you started:

1. Install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). This application takes care of most git workflow tasks.
1. Once installed, open Github Desktop, navigate to the menu, and select `File > Clone Repository...`.
1. In the dialog box that pops up, select the "URL" tab, and put "Global-TIES-for-Children/workshops" into the "Repository URL or GitHub username and repository" field.
